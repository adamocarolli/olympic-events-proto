The prototype allows users to explore olympic events data, specifically, the prototype
is meant to provide users with a tool to compare countries against each other.

Allowing users to answer questions like "Which countries have the most older olympic medalists?", or "Which countries have the most olympic medalists within the years 1900-1925? How does this compare with the years 2000-2015?" or any imagineable combination of these (and other) fields.
